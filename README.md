# credit_risk_analysis
## Project Overview
Given a credit card data set from a Peer-to-Peer lending service company, we will use a number of sampling algorithims to create models that will predict credit risk and assist us in our decision making process. We will test various over sampling, under sampling, and combination algorithims to ascertain the most effective algorithim to use. We will also compare two machine learning models to determine which performs the best and decide if it should be a tool used in the future when determining credit risk.
